          <h2>What do cats eat?</h2>
            <p>They eat once in the morning and once at night, but the exact time doesn't matter that much.<p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Izzy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Shut the kitchen door when she’s eating so Paws doesn’t steal all her food!!!</li>
                <li>Izzy gets a 1/2 can of wet food and her bowl of dry food. Fill her bowl up and let her eat as much as she wants.</li>
                <li>Her bowl goes on the floor by the metal kitchen cart.</li> 
                <li>If you’re in a hurry, you can just leave her shut in the kitchen all day/night. If you feel like hanging out, give her like 15 minutes at least to eat, then you can open the door.</li>
              </ul>

          <hr> 

          <h3>Paws</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Paws is <span class="blink">ALWAYS hungry!!!</span> Don't let him eat Izzy's food!</li>
                <li>Paws eats raw food. It’s in the rectangular metal container in the fridge.</li>
                <li>He gets 2 pellets in the morning and 2.5 at night.</li>
                <li>He eats in the bathroom (like a classy dude). Put his dish in the bathroom and close the door to the kitchen so Izzy can eat in peace. He might try to rush into the kitchen to get her food, so keep an eye on him.</li>
                <li>When the food in the fridge is gone, just refill the container with more food from the freezer. It takes 12 hours or so to defrost, so fill it up as soon as it’s out so it’s ready for the next meal.</li>
                <li>Since it’s raw, it’s important to wash the bowls before you use them again. He has a metal bowl and little glass dishes that we’ll leave out.</li>
                <li>Also, if you leave ANY food out he will definitely eat it, so watch your snacks if you have any!</li>
              </ul>

          <hr>

          <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>The water bowl is in the kitchen, on the floor by the window. Just check that it's at least half full-ish.</p>

          <h2>Pooping</h2>
            <p>We’ll set up two litter boxes for them, one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen. It would be awesome if you could scoop every day. We’ll leave out plastic bags for poops. When you’re done, you can just leave the plastic bags in the laundry room (just outside the back door in the kitchen). We’ll take care of it all when we get back.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the cats throw up. Sorry, it’s gross, I hope it doesn’t happen. We’ll leave out cleaning spray and rags just in case. You can toss any dirty rags into the enamel bin in the laundry room (on the floor by the dryer).</p>
